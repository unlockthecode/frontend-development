            I was a ghost, I was alone <br>
            Eoduwojin apgilsoge (Hah) <br>
            Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe (Hah) <br>
            I was the queen that I'm meant to be (Ah) <br>
            I lived two lives, tried to play both sides <br>
            But I couldn't find my own place (Oh, oh) <br>
            Called a problem child, 'cause I got too wild <br>
            But now that's how I'm getting paid, kkeuteopsi on stage

            We dreamin' hard, we came so far <br>
            Now I believe
