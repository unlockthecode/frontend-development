[ Learning Hypertext Markup Language ]

https://youtu.be/mJgBOIoGihA - HTML Full Course for Beginners | Complete All-in-One Tutorial | 4 Hours


Shortcuts:
element + tab (i.e html+tab = <html></html>)
alt + l + alt + o (opens live server)
alt + z (text wrap)

Chapter 1:
> Prettier, vscode-icons, and github theme extensions are optional but looks good
> Live Server extension will be useful to view your project
    - After installing, right click inside any of your html file and you can open it in your browser immediately and host it locally in your pc
    - Bottom right you can see a stop icon in a port if you are live OR "Start Live" if it's off.
> Only put 1 h1 element in a page
> Inside the head we put the title and meta elements.
    - In the tutorial he puts some styling (css) under head as well.
> W3C Markup Validation Service
    - It makes the standards for the web overall, and we can use it to check for any mistakes
    - validator.w3.org
    - Important to use as reference.
    - I needed to put lang attribute to the html start tag.
    - I also needed to put !DOCTYPE html before the actual html element.
    - Finally, I put <meta charset="UTF-8"> inside the head element.
> Elements vs Attributes
    - Attributes are properties of elements

Chapter 2: Head Element
> Anything inside the Head Element is not seen in the webpage itself. It is something that's behind the scenes

> Attributes of the meta element so far
    - charset, name, content
> To my understanding we break something like 
    <meta name="author" content="UnlockTheCode"> 
    name = type, content = inside that type
> Inside the head element we can put an icon via
    <link rel="icon" href="../resources/home.png" type="image/x-icon">
    - link element, rel attribute (for reference), href for what you want inside, type for itself.
    - flaticon.com has a lot of free icons as long as you put proper credits
    Example:
    <footer>
        Uicons by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/uicons">Flaticon</a>
    </footer>
> Inside the head element, he moved his previous styling into a proper separate css sheet.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    - link element, rel attribute (for preset types), href for where your style sheet is located.
