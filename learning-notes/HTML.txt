Shortcuts:
element + tab               (i.e html+tab = <html></html>)
alt + l + alt + o           (opens live server)
alt + z                     (text wrap)
shift + alt + down arrow    (duplicate a line)

Chapter 1:
> Prettier, vscode-icons, and github theme extensions are optional but looks good
> Live Server extension will be useful to view your project
    - After installing, right click inside any of your html file and you can open it in your browser immediately and host it locally in your pc
    - Bottom right you can see a stop icon in a port if you are live OR "Start Live" if it's off.
> Only put 1 h1 element in a page
> Inside the head we put the title and meta elements.
    - In the tutorial he puts some styling (css) under head as well.
> W3C Markup Validation Service
    - It makes the standards for the web overall, and we can use it to check for any mistakes
    - validator.w3.org
    - Important to use as reference.
    - I needed to put lang attribute to the html start tag.
    - I also needed to put !DOCTYPE html before the actual html element.
    - Finally, I put <meta charset="UTF-8"> inside the head element.
> Elements vs Attributes
    - Attributes are properties of elements

Chapter 2: Head Element
> Anything inside the Head Element is not seen in the webpage itself. It is something that's behind the scenes

> Attributes of the meta element so far
    - charset, name, content
> To my understanding we break something like 
    <meta name="author" content="UnlockTheCode"> 
    name = type, content = inside that type
> Inside the head element we can put an icon via
    <link rel="icon" href="../resources/home.png" type="image/x-icon">
    - link element, rel attribute (for reference), href for what you want inside, type for itself.
    - flaticon.com has a lot of free icons as long as you put proper credits
    Example: (inside the body element)
    <footer>
        Uicons by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/uicons">Flaticon</a>
    </footer>
> Inside the head element, he moved his previous styling into a proper separate css sheet.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
    - link element, rel attribute (for preset types), href for where your style sheet is located.

Chapter 3: Basics of Text Contents
> Webpages are alike newspapers with headings and paragraphs of texts
> Headings have hierarchy, h1 -> h2 -> ... 
> If you can tell from this point, there are spaces between your contents but we can fix it later.
> Use <hr> (horizontal rule) element to break headings apart and style later.
> HTML doesn't honor spaces, this is called whitespace collapsing.
    - Something we can do is use a line break "<br>"
> Block vs Inline level elements 
    - Block-level elements create a "block" that takes up the full available width and starts on a new line. They stack vertically and can contain other block-level or inline elements.
    - Inline elements flow within the text content and only take up as much width as necessary. They don't start on new lines.

Common block-level elements: 
<div>, <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <form>, <table>, <blockquote>

Common inline elements:
<span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <button>, <code>, <small>, <sub>, <sup>

> Semantics / HTML entities (Do note that the listed behaviors are their "default" but it can be changed in css.)
    <em> - </em>            - Makes text italicized but also serves as a marker for web readers to emphasize that text.
    <strong> - </strong>    - It makes it a little bit bigger, same purpose as above but bigger emphasis.
    &nbsp;                  - Makes a tab/indent 
    &lt;                    - "<" symbol
    &gt;                    - ">" symbol
    &copy;                  - Copyright Symbol 
    <abbr> - </abbr>        - abbreviation
    <address> - </address>  - Location/place for any webreader to recognize a text is referring to a location.
    <!-- Comment -->        - Comments in the HTML/source code
> Some usage shown:
    <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr>  - puts dots below and if hovered over we see a tooltip with the meaning
